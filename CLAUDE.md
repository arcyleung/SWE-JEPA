## Project Context
- Teacher extraction validated on 3 models (see results in docs/phase0_results.md)
- Best config: Coder-3B Base at layer 18 (mid-layer extraction avoids last-layer collapse)
- Instruct models show monotonic differentiation; base models show U-shaped curve
- Next step: full pairwise similarity matrix, then Experiment 0.2 (agent dataset retrieval)
